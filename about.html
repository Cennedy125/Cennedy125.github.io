	 <p>Kennedy Ellison is a junior at  <strong><a href="http://brynmawr.edu/">Bryn Mawr College</a></strong> studying Computer Science. Originally, Kennedy began her time at Bryn Mawr studying biochemistry with the intent of going to medical school, but instead found her passion after taking an introductory computer science class.
She is now interested in how medicine and technology intersect as well as artificial intelligence and accessibility in technology. </p>


	      <p>Outside of academics, Kennedy loves to have adventures outdoors, whether that be hiking, rock-climbing, or backpacking. She enjoys to photograph those adventures, and the pictures on this website were taken by Kennedy on her various adventures around the United States. Kennedy also enjoys playing with her dog, Toffee a retired therapy dog, and taking Toffee on her adventures. </p>

	<p>Since choosing to pursue technology, Kennedy has eagerly worked on class projects and side projects as well as a Hackathon. She spent the summer of 2017 working at Vanguard as an Application Development intern. Kennedy learned significantly about how code is developed on teams and how to navigate a large pre-existing code base. She looks forward to new opportunities for growth and learning in the future. </p>
